What did you notice about the commit history after merge?

After completing the merge, I noticed that the commit history now clearly reflects
the integration of the feature branch into the main branch, preserving all individual commits
from the feature work alongside the commits from the main branch. This creates a unified, linear history
that shows the development process while maintaining the context of each change. The merge commit acts
as a clear marker, signaling where the feature was incorporated, which helps in understanding the projectâ€™s evolution.
Overall, this approach keeps the history organized and transparent, making collaboration and
future troubleshooting much easier.
