What did you notice about the file and commit history after the reset?

After running the hard reset, I noticed that both the commit history and
working directory were taken back to the exact state of the selected previous commit.
All commits made after that point were no longer present, and any files or changes
introduced since then were removed. It became clear that a hard reset
not only changes the commit history but also permanently discards changes in the working directory,
making it a powerful but potentially risky command if not used carefully.
