What did you notice about the commit history after switching from macro to micro commits?

After switching from macro to micro commits, the commit history became noticeably more organized and easier to follow.
Previously, using macro commits, a single commit would often bundle changes from multiple files or
even different features, making it harder to understand the purpose behind each update. With micro commits,
each commit is smaller and more focusedâ€”often targeting just one file or a single, logical change.
This shift has made the history much clearer, more maintainable, and easier to review. It also helps
when tracking down bugs or understanding the evolution of a specific part of the codebase. Overall, the change
has brought more structure and clarity to the development process.
