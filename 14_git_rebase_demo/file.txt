What did you notice about the commit history after rebase?


After performing the rebase, I noticed that the feature branch commits
were reapplied on top of the latest commit from the main branch
â€” in this case, the hotfix. This effectively created a cleaner,
linear history, avoiding a merge commit and making it easier to understand
the chronological order of changes. It was insightful to see how rebase
maintains commit integrity while aligning branches more cleanly, which is especially valuable
when preparing for a clean integration of feature work. It also reinforced
the importance of rebasing local feature branches regularly to stay up-to-date with main,
especially in collaborative environments.
