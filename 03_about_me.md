## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because they’re really important tools for anyone coding today. Git helps me keep track of all my changes so I don’t lose any progress, and GitHub makes it easy to share my work and collaborate with classmates and teachers. Knowing how to use these tools will not only make me better at managing my projects but also get me ready to work with others in real-world situations. It’s a skill that will help me keep improving and stay up-to-date in my programming journey.
