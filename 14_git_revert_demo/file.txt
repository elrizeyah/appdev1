What did you notice about the file and commit history after the revert?

One thing I noticed after running git revert is that the changes
from my last commit were undone — the file I previously added
was no longer present in the working directory. However, the original commit
still appeared in the git log --oneline history. This helped me understand
that git revert doesn’t delete a commit, but rather adds a new one
that reverses its changes. It’s a useful and safer way to undo changes
while keeping the commit history intact and traceable.
